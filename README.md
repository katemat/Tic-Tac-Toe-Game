This game is a simple Javascript web application, a digital version of well-known game 'Tic Tac Toe'. 

### Main rules:
* 2 Players
* **Scissors Player** always goes First
* The player who succeeds in placing 3 of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner
* Once the game has a winner or there is a draw, there will be a dialog informing about the result. 
    From here you can:
    - Repeat the game with the same players selection and keeping track on wins and total games played
    - Start a new game

### Problem Solved

**1. Created working solution in given time**
 - 2 players can play (switching turns on one device)
 - when there is a winner(or a draw) the message is displayed and
 - two options is given: 
   - continue game (with keeping track of all results)
   - start new game (no records saved)
 **2. Added some animation and sound effects for improving UX experience**
 
 ### How it was done
 * started with simple steps, breaking big problem into small tasks
 * constantly used development tools (console.log) to debug and fix any small bugs before it grow :)
 * have a lot of coffee and a walk outside (avoid any contact with outside world lol, social distance rules applies  due to COVID-19 :(
